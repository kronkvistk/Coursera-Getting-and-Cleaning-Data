# About the data

The data is from an experiment where 30 volunteers performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). The smartphone on their waist recorded pre-processed accelerometer and gyroscope signals. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The features (561 of them) are unlabeled and can be found in the x_test.txt. The six activity labels are in the y_test.txt file. The test subjects (volunteer ID) are in the subject_test.txt file.

The same holds for the training set.
